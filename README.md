# Module 18 Challenge

## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a blockchain-based ledger system, complete with a user-friendly web interface using Streamlit.

## Technology

Python 3.9.7 to write the blockchain-based ledger system.
Streamlit 1.21.0 was used to develop the front-end application.

## Usage

1. After cloning the github repository, navigate to the folder `Module_18_Challenge` using Terminal
2. In Terminal, run the Streamlit application by executing the following code: `streamlit run pychain.py`
3. Enter values for the sender, receiver, and amount, and then click the "Add Block" button. Do this several times to store several blocks in the ledger.
4. Verify the block contents and hashes in the Streamlit drop-down menu.
